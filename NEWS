Version 0.7.1

A replacement of 0.7.0, there was a bug that prevented grossd
from compiling --with-worker=postfix.

Version 0.7.0

Implemented a thread pool feature. Worker threads are now 
reused, instead of firing up one on each connection. Numerous
bug fixes, most notably byte order related bugs in proto_sjsms.c.
Some configuration file changes: peerhost and synchost has been
replaced by sync_listen and sync_peer.

#Issues fixed:
#15: postfix protocol broken
#17: proto-sjsms breaks between hosts of different endianess

Version 0.6.3

Ported to OS X. Since sem_getvalue() is not implemented on 
OS X, skipping unresponsive dnsbls does not work, yet.

Issues fixed:
#14: processing delay should be included in the logs

Issues fixed:
#1: -lpthread also on Solaris 9.
#2: Logging has been trimmed down.

#12: grosscheck now sends empty sender address as <> in query to grossd.

$prefix/lib/gross/
