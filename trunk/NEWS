Version svn

* preliminary support for MILTER protocol, check config file
* support for definitive checks: it's now possible to write 
  checks that cause grossd to block or pass (whitelisting)

- refactored tread counting in thread_pool.c

Version 0.8.2

- updating mappings example in INSTALL
- logging less verbose (one line per query)

Issues fixed:
#39: blocker queries cause segmentation fault
#43: Lot's of open udp connections when using grosscheck

Version 0.8.1

A couple of bugs fixed.

Issues fixed:
#35: grossd crashes when starting
#36: synchronization still loses one update message

Version 0.8.0

In short: Important changes from the previous version

* You must configure protocols in config file. This is done via
  'protocol' config file parameter. Either 'protocol = sjsms' or
  'protocol = postfix' or both.
* 'sync_host' and 'peer_host' has been deprecated. Use new
  'sync_listen' and 'sync_peer' options.


The longer list:
- Checks are now done in thread pools, which makes it easier to
  develop new checks, like Sophos blocker or SPF. 
- grossd can log aggregate statistics about query results. Check
  'stat_type' and 'stat_interval' configuration parameters.
- grossd can now serve different query protocols simultaneously.
  This is controlled by the 'protocol' config parameter.
- Preliminary support for Sophos blocker. Not yet production
  quality, needs testing. Check issue #19.
- check also doc/examples/grossd.conf, which make install will
  install as the default config file if there is no existing
  grossd.conf

Issues fixed:
#16: synchronization is confusing to configure
#18: documented and configurable timeouts
#23: Customizable SMTP error messages
#26: connections could come from different IP addresses
#27: configurable greylisting time
#28: Bug in the mapping file example
#29: dnsbl tolerance counters not working on OS X
#31: Get rid of --with-worker configure option
#32: gcc makes grosscheck so dependent on libgcc_s.so.1
#33: Update queue synchronizing


Version 0.7.2

- Configurable log_level and syslog_method.
- Message queue enhancements under the hood
- Status counters for various events implemented
- You can now use host names in the configuration

Issues fixed:
#20: allow host names in configuration
#21: A dry run option for testing needed
#22: configurable logging

Version 0.7.1

A replacement of 0.7.0, there was a bug that prevented grossd
from compiling --with-worker=postfix.

Version 0.7.0

Implemented a thread pool feature. Worker threads are now 
reused, instead of firing up one on each connection. Numerous
bug fixes, most notably byte order related bugs in proto_sjsms.c.
Some configuration file changes: peerhost and synchost has been
replaced by sync_listen and sync_peer.

#Issues fixed:
#15: postfix protocol broken
#17: proto-sjsms breaks between hosts of different endianess

Version 0.6.3

Ported to OS X. Since sem_getvalue() is not implemented on 
OS X, skipping unresponsive dnsbls does not work, yet.

Issues fixed:
#14: processing delay should be included in the logs

Version 0.6.2

Issues fixed:
#1: -lpthread also on Solaris 9.
#2: Logging has been trimmed down.
#7: Libdir is now installed same as other directories.
#8: Removed relays.ordb.org from example config.
#9: SJSMS client library path corrected in INSTALL.
#10: Default config file path is now correct with default prefix.
#11: Implemented -D command line option for enabling debug logging.
#12: grosscheck now sends empty sender address as <> in query to grossd.

- Installs libraries to $prefix/lib/ instead of previous
$prefix/lib/gross/

Version 0.6.1

- You can now create statfile with grossd -C command line option
- Config file defaults to $sysconfdir/grossd.conf
- example config in doc/examples/grossd.conf
