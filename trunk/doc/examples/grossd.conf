#
# This is a sample configuration for grossd
#
# This file includes all valid configuration parameters, with their
# default values. All the default values are commented out, so any 
# all lines not commented out change the default settings. 
# 
# you can also add comments after a line 	# this is a comment


# 'host' is the address the server should listen for queries
# DEFAULT: host = localhost

# 'port' is the port the server should listen for queries
# DEFAULT: port = 1111

# 'protocol' activates the server protocols grossd will support
# Valid protocols are 'sjsms', 'postfix' and 'milter'
protocol = sjsms
protocol = postfix

# 'stat_type' is the name of the requested statistic. There can be multiple
# 'stat_type' options in the configuration file (Using both none and full is
# undefined). Default is none. Valid options are currently:
# full: grossd sends all possible statistics
# none: no statistics at all
# status: basic statistics set
# since_startup: basic set since the startup 
# delay: processing delay statistics
# EXAMPLE: stat_type = status
# EXAMPLE: stat_type = delay

# 'stat_interval' is the number of seconds between status log entries
# DEFAULT: stat_interval = 3600

# 'filter_bits' is the size of the bloom filter. Size will be 2^filter_bits
# lowering this value will increase the probability of false matches
# in each individual bloom filter
# DEFAULT: filter_bits = 24

# 'number_buffers' is the number of filters used in the ring queue
# raising this value will cause an entry to stay in the servers' memory longer
# DEFAULT: number_buffers = 8

# 'rotate_interval' is the number of seconds between filter rotation.
# Let N := 'number_buffers' and I := 'rotate_interval'. An entry will
# stay in the servers' memory for (N - 0.5) * I seconds in average. 
# DEFAULT: rotate_interval = 3600

# 'sync_listen' is the address to listen for communication with the peer
# defaults to 'host' option
# sync_listen = 

# 'sync_peer' is the address of the peer used in clustered mode
# sync_peer = 

# 'sync_port' is the port number to listen to and connect to in 
# communication with the peer. 
# DEFAULT: sync_port = 1112

# 'statefile' is path of the file that the server will use to store the
# state information. 
# statefile = 

# 'log_method' is used to list all the possible logging facilities.
# currently only syslog is implemented
# DEFAULT: log_method = syslog

# 'log_level' Possible log levels are 'debug', 'info', 'notice'
# 'warning' and 'error'.
# DEFAULT: log_level = info

# 'syslog_facility' is the facility syslog sends log messages with.
# DEFAULT: syslog_facility = mail

# 'update' is the way server updates the database. Valid options are
# 'grey' and 'always'. If 'update = grey' grossd will update the database
# only if response is STATUS_GREY 
# DEFAULT: update = grey

# 'grey_mask' is the mask for grossd to use when matching client_ip
# against the database. You may set it to 24 to treat  addresses
# like a.b.c.d as a.b.c.0.
# DEFAULT: grey_mask = 0

# 'grey_delay' is the time in seconds new triplets are kept on the greylist.
# DEFAULT: grey_delay = 10

# 'check' lists all the checks grossd will do to judge if client_ip is
# suspicious or not. 
check = dnsbl
#check = rhsbl
#check = dnswl

# 'dnsbl' is a dns domain name of the dnsbl that 'dnsbl' check will query
# There are no defaults, but below is a list of dnsbls you could be using
# dnsbl = rbl-plus.mail-abuse.net # this is not free
dnsbl = bl.spamcop.net
dnsbl = combined.njabl.org
dnsbl = cbl.abuseat.org
dnsbl = dnsbl.sorbs.net

# 'rhsbl' is analogous to 'dnsbl'
#rhsbl = rhsbl.sorbs.net

# 'dnswl' is analogous to 'dnsbl'. Remember that dnswl is a *definitive*
# check, that is grossd waits for the check to complete before deciding
# how to respond. This may cause unwanted latency. Highly recommended if
# you use grossd as a traditional greylister.
#dnswl = query.bondedsender.org 

# 'blocker_host' is the host name of the Sophos blocker server.
# blocker_host =

# 'blocker_port' is the tcp port of the Sophos blocker service.
# DEFAULT: blocker_port = 4466

# 'milter_listen' is the socket for milter service.
# EXAMPLE: milter_listen = inet:1234@localhost
